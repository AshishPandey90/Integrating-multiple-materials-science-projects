# Graph libraries for machine learning of material science
Demo codes for our paper "Integrating materials science projects with a single neural network"
DOI: ****

# Usage
You can run jupyter notebook codes for the demo codes
(prediction of conductivity of PEDOT-PSS from texts, multitask learning of multiple databases, inverse problems, and control experiments against the graph approach)
 
# Note
Tested by Linux

# Todo
Most codes are written with camel case. Maybe modified in the future...
