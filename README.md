# Databases and graph libraries for machine learning of material science
- These are databases and demo codes for the following paper
- "Integrating multiple materials science projects in a single neural network"
- Published in "Communications Materials"

# Usage
- You can view databases used in the study in a "database" folder
- You can run jupyter notebook codes for the demo codes in a "codes" folder
(prediction of conductivity of PEDOT-PSS from texts, multitask learning of multiple databases, inverse problems, and control experiments against the graph approach)
 
# Note
Tested by Linux

# Todo
Most codes are written with camel case. Maybe modified in the future...
