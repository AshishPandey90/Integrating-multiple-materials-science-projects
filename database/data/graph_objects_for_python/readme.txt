Graph objects saved in "bin" folder.
They were generated from the table-type databases and graphml files.
The objects were used for machine learning after converting into adjacency matrices and node vectors.

You can view the objects via a Python script (GraphFileView.ipynb). Jupyternotebook and related libraries are needed to run the script.
